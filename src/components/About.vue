          CrossAngles is provided by
          <a
            href="https://www.campusbiblestudy.org/"
            target="_blank"
          >Campus Bible Study</a>
          â€” a group of people at UNSW who are
          interested in learning together about Jesus from the Bible.
          Whether you follow Jesus, or want to find out what He's all about,
          Campus Bible Study is a great place for you to learn more.
          If you've never come before, we recommend checking out the Bible talks.

          CrossAngles aims to provide a simple way for students to create their
          timetable for UNSW. However, it is not an official part of the UNSW
          enrolment system, and planning your timetable here does not mean that
          you have enrolled for the Term yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          CrossAngles is similar to
          <a

            target="_blank"
          >Bojangles</a>
          (and the older Rectangles and Octangles), but provides a greater
          degree of customisation, support for mobile devices, and support for
          trimesters (aka. UNSW3+).
